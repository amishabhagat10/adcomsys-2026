                The second edition of the International Conference on Advanced Computing and Systems (AdComSys 2025) will foster an 
                excellent international forum for exchanging knowledge and the recent developments in theory, methodologies, and 
                applications in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, Internet of Things (IoT) systems, 
                cybersecurity and blockchain systems, and emerging computing techniques. AdComSys 2025 aims to foster intense 
                dialogues between academia and industry, bridging the gaps between scholarly research, industrial initiatives, 
                and governmental policymaking. AdComSys 2025 will contribute to the diverse spectrum of keynote addresses, 
                technical tracks, panel discussions, and industry exhibits where academia can view state-of-the-art findings 
                from the trials and interoperability experiments. Furthermore, the industry will benefit from exposure to 
                leading-edge research and an opportunity to interact and fraternize with academic researchers on real-world 
                issues. AdComSys 2025 invites original research and technical papers from researchers, scientists, academicians, 
                industry professionals, and students. These papers are intended to share the experiences, new ideas, and 
                research results related to advanced computing and systems, as well as to discuss the practical challenges 
                faced and solutions implemented. The Department of Computer Science and Technology (CST) & Computer Science 
                and Information Technology (CSIT), University of Engineering and Management in Kolkata, India will host the 
                second International Conference on Advanced Computing and Systems (AdComSys 2025) on the 26th and 27th of June 2025.
