            <p className="content-text">
              Prospective authors are invited to submit original technical papers that have not been submitted 
              elsewhere for publication (copyright infringement issues will be the author's responsibility) 
              in the <b>AdComSys 2025</b> Conference Proceedings. Papers must be written in good english.
              <b>The Conference Management Toolkit</b> (CMT) portal will be used for the submission link. 
              All manuscripts will be double-blind reviewed for technical content and scope by a technical 
              program committee. The authors must submit the paper without including their names and affiliation. 
              The organizers of AdComSys 2024 are strict about Plagiarism. The submitting authors should avoid 
              the deliberate or reckless representation of another’s words, thoughts, or ideas as one’s own 
              without attribution in connection with submitting academic work, whether graded or otherwise. 
              The Technical Program Committee will check the plagiarism level of all the submitted papers 
              to ensure the originality of the content using Turnitin (Turnitin) plagiarism checking software, 
              and any paper having a similarity score above 15% will not be processed further.
